# TSO (Target State Optimization)

This algorithm is used to optimize parameters of vehicle control units by defining optimization targets.

The repository only includes the algorithm itself wihtout the user interface created with PyQt and the connectors to the different APIs to ETAS INCA and the Software in the loop tool Silver.

The algorithm and the results are illustrated here: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/20/10283
